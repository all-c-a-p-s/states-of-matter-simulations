  <h1>Condensation</h1>

  <img src="../../images/condensation.gif">
  <p> When a gasâ€™ temperature is low enough it reaches its condensation point (which is the same as its boiling point).
    This causes the kinetic energy of the particles to decrease enough that they can form temporary attractions and
    bonds meaning they come together to form liquid droplets. These droplets can then fuse to make a full body of
    liquid.
    Fun fact: gaseous water (steam) cannot be seen but condenses into small water droplets in the air to form the foggy
    appearance we all know.</p>
