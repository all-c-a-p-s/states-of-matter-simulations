  <h1>Evaporation</h1>

  <img src="../../images/evaporation.gif">
  <p> Evaporation is an another way in which liquids turn to gas from a temperature often below the liquidâ€™s boiling
    point. As all particles in the liquid have different kinetic energies, there are some particles with higher kinetic
    energies than others. If these particles approach the surface of the liquid at the right angle then they can escape
    to form a gas. As this can only occur at the surface and only for higher energy particles, this process is slow.
    When the temperature of the liquid increases, the rate of evaporation increases. Evaporation is the reason for
    puddles disappearing over time despite never boiling.</p>
